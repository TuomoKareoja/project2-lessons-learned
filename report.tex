\section{Brand Preference Prediction}

\subsection{Lesson 1: Modelling can be used to fix data problems}

There are multiple ways to deal with missing values

We can also think about missing value replacement as a completely separate project

\subsection{Lesson 2: You have to rethink your metrics if multiple models are performing extremely well}

If model accuracy is approaching 100 \%, just comparing the accuracy numbers can be difficult.
AUC curves look almost completely overlapping

Small changes can still mean that one model makes only half as many mistakes

Compare the metrics as percentages of each other

\section{Predicting future sales}

\subsection{Lesson 1: Data that seems only somewhat unrelated to the task at hand can still help}

We were interesting in only a small group of products, but still it was better to use the whole dataset
for the predictions, even though the data included products that seemed very different from the
groups of interest

Possibility of leveraging a different dataset to predict somewhat related metric

\subsection{Lesson 2: Sometimes hyperparameter tuning can make the model perform radically better}

Usually not but sometimes this seems to happen

SVM

\section{Market Basket Analysis}

\subsection{Lesson 1: Always keep the business question in mind}

Without the business goal you would only concentrate on the learning the packages and creating
strong rules

What are actually interesting rules for the business context

Does the advised approach actually best serve the business context

In real business context you should talk with the manager and ask for clarifications
and be clear with the difficulties and limitation you are facing

\subsection{Lesson 2: Ignore the instructions if they seem confusing}

Instead of trying to follow the instructions when they seem clear but make little
sense you should ignore them and keep in mind the business goals

\subsection{Lesson 3: Be prepared to change your approach completely}

It might be that you end spending a long time with some kind of
analysis path, but then it becomes clear that this path is somehow problematic
you must be ready to abandon the previous effort and try something new.
